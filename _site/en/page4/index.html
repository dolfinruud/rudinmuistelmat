<p>The upstairs of OK20 was transformed into a stylish and atmospheric venue for the first ever annual sitsit for the Freshmen of the new Bachelor of Science degree programmes. It was heartwarming to see so many of the new Freshmen coming together and taking part in the sitsit culture with such enthusiasm and joy. The head work of the International Bachelor Freshmen Captains had paid off and the sitsit brought song and cheer into everyone’s hearts and into the ever colder and ever longer autumn nights. It was great to be able to welcome so many new students from around the world into the Teekari culture and see their enjoyment and enthusiasm.</p>

The next project of the Autumn was the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit! Indeed, the Teekkari Tradition Week itself was kicked off by the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit, which the Freshmen Captains of my committee had been preparing for diligently. Once again I could say that I was proud (and still am) of my Freshmen Captains and that it is a pleasure to lead the FTMK.</p>

<p>There were outstanding performances and taste bud tickling food. Hopefully the Freshmen and their Captains enjoyed the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit at least as much as I did. The rest of the week was then filled with all kinds of various goodies: I myself took part in Poli’s Pub Crawl and the sing-through of the Red and not to forget the highlight of the whole week, the Teekkari Tradition Celebration. The week was truly magical and unforgettable. I for one am not ever going to forget the Teekkari Tradition Week of 2019!</p>

<p>Next up were the Freshmen Sitsit. I was able to attend the Freshmen Sitsit organised by the guilds of my committee and I could never wait to attend the next guild’s Freshmen Sitsit. I was also very flattered to have been invited to all the Freshmen Sitsit together with the Phuxivator.</p>

<p>The part I was looking forward to the most was the chance to experience the different singing cultures of all the guilds, as well as seeing what their Freshmen Sitsit would be like! Unfortunately for me and some of the Freshmen Captains, I was not able to attend all of the Freshmen Sitsit and see just how well the Freshmen had learned the Sitsi culture from the training. I prepared for the Freshmen Sitsit by getting my Sitsit gear into shape, grabbing my song book, putting on my Teekkari Cap and then heading to the Freshmen Sitsit! The Freshmen Sitsit were very good and it was delightful to see how some of the Freshmen were brave enough to request some songs from the song masters and even lead one or two songs of their own! The Freshmen had clearly taken on board the teachings from the Sitsit trainings and seemed to have fun!</p>
