A cold flake of snow flew into my face yet it did not disturb the sea of asphalt that rose and fell so beautifully in Otaniemi, Teekkarikylä and Otakaari. We had saunas to make sure that they were working correctly. I just needed to remember to inform the IE-director of this. Brave freshmen marched the lands and fields, performing tricks, dances, jumps in order to receive credit where credit was due. New winds started to blow and peace crawled up to the Major’s heart. It’s time for the night.

The fabulous festivities started off in high spirits and I couldn’t hear the Freshmen Captains over the booming of the dance floor! Even the new guards got changed into their vests and were ready for action.The night grew darker and louder, the party was just getting started. The performer was a success and of course the company was fantastic. It was really an honor to watch the freshmen reach for the skies. I wonder, I feel a little breeze of spring in the air.
