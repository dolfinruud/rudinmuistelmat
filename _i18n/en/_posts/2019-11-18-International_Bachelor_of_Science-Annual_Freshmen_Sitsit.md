The upstairs of OK20 was transformed into a stylish and atmospheric venue for the first ever annual sitsit for the Freshmen of the new Bachelor of Science degree programmes. It was heartwarming to see so many of the new Freshmen coming together and taking part in the sitsit culture with such enthusiasm and joy. The head work of the International Bachelor Freshmen Captains had paid off and the sitsit brought song and cheer into everyoneâ€™s hearts and into the ever colder and ever longer autumn nights. It was great to be able to welcome so many new students from around the world into the Teekari culture and see their enjoyment and enthusiasm.
