What a week! The whole week was absolutely amazing and the Freshmen joined the Ota-Orienteering in high spirits! The Freshmen Captains had been looking forward to the orientation week and the arrival of the Freshmen wholeheartedly for a long time, which you could see from a mile off.

Everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun, at least as far as my committee and I were concerned. Hopefully the Freshmen also enjoyed themselves equally. At least at the Ota-Orienteering the Freshmen really seemed to have fun and hopefully they got to know each other and found new friends within the community. Now we turn our heads to the Helsinki Orienteering and all the shenanigans it will bring.
