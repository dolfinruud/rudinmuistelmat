This is the disappointment of all disappointments. The situation caused by the Corona virus has already been going on for two weeks. Wappu is coming and the new white Teekkari Caps for the Freshmen will soon be here. It is time to roll up our sleeves and crack down, as nothing in this world can stop the birth of the new Teekkari generation! Freshmen must get their caps by hook or by crook.
