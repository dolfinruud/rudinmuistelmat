The next project of the Autumn was the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit! Indeed, the Teekkari Tradition Week itself was kicked off by the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit, which the Freshmen Captains of my committee had been preparing for diligently. Once again I could say that I was proud (and still am) of my Freshmen Captains and that it is a pleasure to lead the FTMK.

There were outstanding performances and taste bud tickling food. Hopefully the Freshmen and their Captains enjoyed the Freshmen Celebration Sitsit at least as much as I did. The rest of the week was then filled with all kinds of various goodies: I myself took part in Poliâ€™s Pub Crawl and the sing-through of the Red and not to forget the highlight of the whole week, the Teekkari Tradition Celebration. The week was truly magical and unforgettable. I for one am not ever going to forget the Teekkari Tradition Week of 2019!
