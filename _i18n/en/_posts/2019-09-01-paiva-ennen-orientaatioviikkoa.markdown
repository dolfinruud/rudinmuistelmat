title: "The day before the orientation"
---
It turns out that I finally came to the decision to keep this virtual diary where I could record my memories of all the things that I have done and considered throughout this year.

The first thing that comes to mind now is the Head Starts which took place in August and which I visited with the Phuxvator to bring our greetings. It was nice to tour these and to see the Freshmen of 2019 for the first time, which my committee of Freshmen Captains guided at full speed from the start of the Orientation Week onwards. Everyone must have been at least equally as excited as I was about the Orientation Week and also about suddenly being surrounded by over a thousand new people together with whom we then spent the Freshman year. 

It is also interesting to consider how Freshmen from all around Finland and now even from around the world are coming to join the Aalto community and study!
