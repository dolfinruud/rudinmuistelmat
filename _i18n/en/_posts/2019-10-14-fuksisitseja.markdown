Next up were the Freshmen Sitsit. I was able to attend the Freshmen Sitsit organised by the guilds of my committee and I could never wait to attend the next guildâ€™s Freshmen Sitsit. I was also very flattered to have been invited to all the Freshmen Sitsit together with the Phuxivator.

The part I was looking forward to the most was the chance to experience the different singing cultures of all the guilds, as well as seeing what their Freshmen Sitsit would be like! Unfortunately for me and some of the Freshmen Captains, I was not able to attend all of the Freshmen Sitsit and see just how well the Freshmen had learned the Sitsi culture from the training. I prepared for the Freshmen Sitsit by getting my Sitsit gear into shape, grabbing my song book, putting on my Teekkari Cap and then heading to the Freshmen Sitsit! The Freshmen Sitsit were very good and it was delightful to see how some of the Freshmen were brave enough to request some songs from the song masters and even lead one or two songs of their own! The Freshmen had clearly taken on board the teachings from the Sitsit trainings and seemed to have fun!
