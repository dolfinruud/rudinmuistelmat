title: "Freshman committee’s recreation"
---

It was very nice to see my own committee again! A lot of work had been done over the autumn and it was finally time for our recreation days with the whole Freshman Committee. Overcooked and Disney-monopoly was great fun with the Captains! 

Last week we also had FTMK’s pre Christmas party. We made food together and enjoyed the warmth of the sauna. It was nice to see how the committee keeps going and has been keeping spirits high despite the tiring and intense autumn.
