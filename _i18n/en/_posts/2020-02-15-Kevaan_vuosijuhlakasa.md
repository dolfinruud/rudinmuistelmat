Was wonderful to represent the freshmen committee in Potentiaalin Tasaus. SIK turned 99 and the ball was fancier than ever. We got to dine and enjoy the main event in Vanha Poli at Bulevardi which is the the old home of technical university. The ball was great and we got to see some old friends in the annual ball committee as well. We had a blast and off we went to sillis in the the next morning. SIK turns 100 this year and the starting blast of the year started at sillis. Got to go home with a belly full of food.
